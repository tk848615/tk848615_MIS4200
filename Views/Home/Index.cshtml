        <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up in a city called Westlake, Ohio.  It is about 20 minutes west of Cleveland.

        <h2>Currently</h2>
        <p>Right now I am a senior at Ohio University. Most notably, I'm member of the Marching 110 where I play trombone. We get to do a lot of cool things in the band such as NFL halftime performances, the Macy's Thankgivng Day Parade, and traveling to Japan in the Summer of 2020.</p>
